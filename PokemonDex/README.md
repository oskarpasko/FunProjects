## Ideas

Ideas for the near future:
- Try to move mechanics with fight to some method to new file fight.py for example. 
- Try to improve fight method
- Create 'Search pokemon' mechanics, This mechanics should search new wild pokemons until player wants to leave

Ideas for later:
- Add mechanics with throwing berry to decrease catch rate 
- Add other kinds of pokeballs
- Add mechanics to save game on files 


Ideas for save game:
- Data like player name, caught Pokémons, seen Pokémon
should be storage in files 
- Player name should be storage in file and if this file is not empty, that name in file is player's name
- Add option to clear all files
- Empty file with player's name mean start new game and clear all other files with data 
- At start game check files, if they are not empty assign files data to code variables,
If player's name file is not empty, assign other files to variables 


Ideas for plot:
- Pokemons from gen 3 from Pokémon Emerald
- Start with Professor
- You can talk with people
- Can't fight and can't collect iteams of first versions
